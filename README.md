Totally Fucked

Credz: Special thx 2 Todd Bailey / Andrew Reitano of Narrat1ve for preserving this work by rescuing this ROM in 2013 off of the one remaining cartridge I managed somehow to save from 2003. Thus, there is no source code, just the compiled ROMs FYI.   

Requirements: Nintendo Entertainment System, Super Mario Bros. cartridge, CRT television, 27C256 EEPROM & socket.

Elevator pitch: Modified Mario Bros game cartridge where Mario is stuck on a cube forever (and fidgits from side to side)
